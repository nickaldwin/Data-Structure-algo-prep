//The question
Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8


// The answer
function rowSumOddNumbers(n)
{
  /* The rows' start numbers are Hogben's centered polygonal numbers:
     1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43 = b[n] = n^2 - n + 1.
     <https://oeis.org/A002061>
     
     The sum of one row is given by:
     s[n] = n^2 + n(b[n] - 1).

     Inline b[n]:
     s[n] = n^2 + n(n^2 - n + 1 - 1)
          = n^2 + n(n^2 - n)
          = n^2 + n^3 - n^2
          = n^3
     ... oh. */
  return n * n * n;
}
