 What is the difference between var and let?
- var and let are both keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript. However, there are some key differences between the two.
- Scope: Variables declared with var are global by default, while variables declared with let are only accessible within the block in which they are declared.
- Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, while variables declared with let are not. This means that a variable declared with let can only be accessed after it has been declared, while a variable declared with var can be accessed before it has been declared.
-  Mutable vs. Immutable: Variables declared with var are mutable, which means that their value can be changed after they have been declared. Variables declared with let are immutable, which means that their value cannot be changed after they have been declared.

What are the different types of data that can be stored in a variable?

-  `Numbers`
-  `Strings`
-   `Booleans`
-    `Objects`
-    `Arrays`
-     `Functions`

What are the different types of loops that can be used in JavaScript?

JavaScript has four types of loops:

    While loop: A while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is met.
    Do-while loop: A do-while loop executes a block of code once, and then continues to execute the block of code as long as a condition is met.
    For loop: A for loop executes a block of code a specified number of times.
    forEach loop: A forEach loop executes a function for each item in an array.

What are the different types of conditional statements that can be used in JavaScript?

JavaScript has three types of conditional statements:

    If statement: An if statement executes a block of code if a condition is met.
    Else statement: An else statement executes a block of code if the condition in an if statement is not met.
    Else if statement: An else if statement executes a block of code if a condition is met, but only if the condition in an if statement is not met.

What are the different ways to create functions in JavaScript?

There are two ways to create functions in JavaScript:

    Function declaration: A function declaration is a traditional way to define a function. It is used to define a function that can be called later on in the code.
    Function expression: A function expression is a more dynamic way to define a function. It is used to define a function that is only valid within the current scope.

Here is an example of a function declaration:
Code snippet

function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
